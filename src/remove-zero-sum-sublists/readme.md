(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
Output: [3,1]
Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
Output: [1]

Constraints:

The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.
